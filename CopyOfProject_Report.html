<h1>General Information</h1>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<p>Our initial interest in national parks began with basic questions
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are general historical trends reflected in national park
data?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the seasonal visitation trends for national
parks?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of activities are offered by national parks?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our initial exploratory data analysis prompted us to ask more nuanced
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can we wrangle complex and visualize traffic count data into
an informative database for the wider knowledge community?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we categorize the nuances of seasonal trends in national
parks? For example, seasonal trends based on activities, seasonal trends
based on national park type.</p></li>
<li><p>How can we identify national parks that are decreasing in visitor
interest?</p></li>
<li><p>Using a linear model, can an average visit to a national park be
predicted by the number of activities offered by the park?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="project-motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
<p>The project aims to investigate patterns and trends in visitation to
national parks across the United States, with the central focus on
understanding the various factors of influence such as visitation types,
seasonal trends, historical events, and camping activities. As frequent
enjoys of the parks, we hope to investigate what makes the parks popular
and understand what tends to drive participation of the public. We hope
that this investigation is useful for both people to get them into going
to the parks and useful for park services to learn what increases
participation. There are over 400 parks in the United States at this
time. In 2023, there were 325.5 million recreation visits, an increase
from 2022. Visitation at the parks has been increasing since the dip in
visitation during 2020 and 2021, with closure of parks due to the
COVID-19 Pandemic (NPS, 2024). We each chose an aspect of the
investigation that appealed most to us. Therefore the project is split
into different sections based on the area of interest for each
collaborator.</p>
</div>
<div id="significance" class="section level2">
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>National Parks are an important part of American society, providing
opportunities for recreation, education, and the preservation of
historical landmarks, endangered landscapes, species, and ecosystems.
These parks also play a significant role in boosting local economies by
drawing visitors to nearby communities. However, accessing these parks
often necessitates driving and parking vehicles, which can lead to
increased human-wildlife interactions and the encroachment of parking
lots on valuable park space. Such infrastructure disrupts the natural
environment and diminishes the ecological integrity of these protected
areas.</p>
<p>Understanding when and why individuals visit National Parks offers
valuable insights for fostering broader public engagement and enhancing
visitor experiences. This paper examines the activities and parks that
resonate most with visitors, providing a basis for strategic planning
and resource allocation. Additionally, it explores the environmental
impacts of vehicle usage in parks, highlighting opportunities for
sustainable solutions that minimize harm to natural habitats. By
identifying trends and preferences, these findings aim to promote
greater park participation while ensuring the preservation of their
natural and cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-used" class="section level2">
<h2>Data used</h2>
<p>We started this project looking at two primary data sources. One
looking at general Park information, from the NPS API. The second was a
csv file generated from the NPS visitation query editor.</p>
<p>Our visitation data includes variables full_name, park_code,
park_type, region, state, year, month, recreation_visits, tent_campers,
rv_campers, backcountry. It has 101419 rows and 11 columns. The only
data cleaning that needed to be done in the visitation data set is to
clean the column names and mutate some of the column names to be able to
merge the full national parks data with the visitation data, as well as
filtering to the data that we wanted to analyze.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>full_name</code>: Includes the full name of the National
Park</p></li>
<li><p><code>park_code</code>: Unique code that identifies each National
Park</p></li>
<li><p><code>park_type</code>: 18 Unique National Park Types</p></li>
<li><p><code>state</code>: State(s) that the park is located</p></li>
<li><p><code>year</code>: Year that the data is collected from</p></li>
<li><p><code>month</code>: Month that the data is collected
from</p></li>
<li><p><code>recreation_visits</code>: Total number of recreation visits
to each National Park</p></li>
<li><p><code>tent_campers</code>: Number of visits that were tent
campers</p></li>
<li><p><code>rv_campers</code>: Number of visits that were RV
campers</p></li>
<li><p><code>backcountry</code>: Number of Backcountry hiker
visits</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Parks data came from the NPS API. To generate this data we first
call the API, convert it from a JSON to a tibble, then select the

<p>In addition to the general data used in this project, I also used
another data set from the API. I also pulled the <code>thingstodo</code>
data set. To clean this similarly to the parks data set, it needed to be
unnested, relevant information selected and some data types converted.
The final data set had the following variables title,
relatedParks_parkCode, latitude, longitude, isReservationRequired,
arePetsPermittedWithRestrictions, activities_id, activities_name,
doFeesApply, arePetsPermitted, season, timeOfDay. It has 3544 rows and
12 columns.</p>

<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>As exploratory data analysis, I looked into the activity counts
across states and parks. I also looked at visitation trends. This is how
I found I wanted to look into the relationship between activities and
visitation. I also looked into entrance cost but ended up going in a
different direction. However, it was after looking into the things to do
data that I noticed there was a discrepancy in the initial parks data.
Some activity categories were showing up under the things to do but not
under the general park information. This means I had to go back and
combine the data sets and redo the analysis to get a more accurate
picture.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis-of-visitation-and-activities" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis of Visitation and Activities</h2>
<p>To do this analysis, after combining the data sets, I looked at the
EDA graph showing the comparison of # of activities to average park
visits per month. While slight I thought there may be a relationship and
decided to run a linear regression.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>I found that the linear regression was significant. This meant there
was a relationship between the number of activities offered by a park
and the average number of visits to that park. Because of this positive
relationship I wanted to look more into the advertised activities in the
things to do data set. This is when I decided to build a shiny app to
look into the different activities offered.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-app" class="section level2">
<h2>Shiny APP</h2>
<p>The shiny app can be found <a
href="https://mlachs.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/">HERE</a>. It allows you to
find the various things to do based on activity category and other

<div id="seasonal-regional-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Seasonal Regional Analysis</h1>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>On initial analysis, it seems that July has the largest total
visitation of any month. Therefore, we wanted to look at how different
visitation looked like across seasons. Splitting the parks by month,
there was clearly seasonal variation, with summer having the highest
number of visitors across most park types. Winter recorded the lowest
visitation levels, except for park types that specifically have
activities that can be done during winter weather. More people visit
national parks overall than any other park type, despite the fact that
there are other park types with more parks across the U.S. There were
some parks with variations, such as National Preserve, that had almost
uniform visitation across the seasons. Looking at the activities offered
there made it obvious that there were activities that could be done in
all seasons.</p>
<p>Analyzing activity-specific trends shows that tent camping is the
most popular activity except in winter, where RV camping is the highest
due to its ability to provide shelter in the winter weather. Backcountry
hiking is the lowest in popularity across seasons, possibly due to the
experience and training that it takes to complete a task such as this
one. There were some park types that had none of these activities,
including National Historic Site, National Memorial, National
Battlefield, and International Historic Site. Additionally, there were
parks that only have Backcountry visitation or RV camping. Doing an
analysis of regional trends on different activities offered in the parks
shows that the west has the most visitation, especially in the summer
months, despite the fact that the south has more visitation overall.
This could be due to the more favorable weather conditions in the states
that these parks are located that allow for more year-round
visitation.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Studying trends in seasonal and regional visitation shows that
several things can be done to improve park visitation. If possible,
parks with low winter visitation could benefit from the inclusion of
winter-specific activities, such as snowshoeing. Additionally, improving
facilities for RV and tent camping could help attract more visitors
year-round. Using these results, the National Parks Service can make
more data-informed decisions in order to optimize visitor experiences
and ensure that the parks continue to preserve America’s precious
landscapes.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Many of the limitations in this project come from the data itself.
One of the datasets was obtained through an API, where each of the
columns was nested. In order to access any of the data contained in
these columns would require several additional steps that is not usually
needed. The two data sets used had different lengths, so joining them to
use data in both was difficult Additionally, many of the parks had
missing state data, which made it difficult to analyze regional trends.
Further study could be conducted on more specific activities that are
the most popular in the parks. The dataset obtained from an API included
only the topics of the activities and not how many people do each
activity. It would be interesting to do data analysis on these
activities to see which ones are the most popular and could help improve
park programming</p>

<h1>Local NY</h1>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis reveals interesting trends across New York State parks.
A key observation is the dominance of summer visitation, which aligns
with warmer weather and increased outdoor activities. Parks such as Fire
Island National Seashore attract the most visitors in summer, reflecting
their appeal as seasonal destinations. Conversely, winter sees lower
overall visitation except in parks equipped with activities suited for
colder climates, such as Vanderbilt Mansion NHS, which exhibits more
consistent attendance across all seasons.</p>
<p>Camping-specific trends highlight that tent camping remains the most
popular activity except during winter, where RV camping surpasses it due
to the shelter provided. Backcountry camping remains the least popular
due to its challenging nature, requiring experience and preparation.
Seasonal variations in visitation further suggest the impact of weather
and regional characteristics on visitor behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The findings underscore the importance of tailoring park activities
and facilities to seasonal demands. For instance, parks with low winter
visitation could consider offering winter-specific activities, such as
skiing or snowshoeing, to attract more visitors. Enhancing camping
facilities, including RV amenities and all-weather shelters, could
encourage year-round visits. The consistent popularity of some parks
across seasons, like Vanderbilt Mansion NHS, highlights the potential
for expanding offerings to engage visitors beyond traditional peak
seasons.</p>
<p>Moreover, understanding regional visitation trends can help the
National Parks Service optimize resource allocation and marketing
strategies. Promoting under-visited parks with unique activities could
balance visitation across the state, ensuring all parks receive adequate
attention and funding.</p>

<h2>Limitation</h2>
<p>This analysis faced a few key challenges. First, the public use
dataset required significant cleaning due to nested and inconsistent
values, which may have affected the results. Missing regional data for
some parks also made it harder to fully capture geographic trends.
Additionally, the activity data only provided general topics, without
details on participation rates, which limited insights into specific
visitor preferences. Finally, trends like the 2020 visitation drop and
the 2006 spring spike seem to align with events like the COVID-19
pandemic and unusual weather, but more data would be needed to confirm
these patterns. Future studies addressing these gaps could provide
richer, more actionable insights.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>To do data analysis on national parks’ traffic count I used the Query
Builder for National Park Traffic Counts.</p>
<p>The datasets include data from 1985 to 2023.</p>
<p>Provided that it was difficult to load data for every single national
park into a single csv file, the National Park Traffic Count data was
loaded separated by U.S. regions: firstly, North- East, secondly
South-East, thirdly Alaska, Intermountain, and Mid-West regions, and
lastly National-Capital and Pacific-West regions.</p>
<p>For each region’s csv file included 15 variables: park name, unit
code, park type, region, traffic counter, year, month, traffic count,
park name total, unit code total, park type total, region total, traffic
counter total, year total, month total, traffic counts total label, and
traffic count total.</p>
<p>National Park datasets included different traffic counters for the
same national park. Where each counter would report a monthly count and
also an annual count.</p>

class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis and Discussion</h2>
<p>In attempts to examine how our interactions with national parks have
evolved over time and with no obvious topic consistently reported in the
news, we determined that the most relevant development in recent history
is the introduction of automobiles to the public. Many national parks
emphasize preservation, but with increasing human contact, management
needs to be flexible. To quantify how human-wildlife interactions have
changed over the years, we can look at visitation pressure. High traffic
volumes indicate heavy visitor use, leading to environmental
degradation, pollution, and wildlife disturbance.</p>
<p>Initial exploration of the data highlighted how traffic counts differ
across types of national parks even within the same state. Furthermore,
differ across the various traffic counters for each national park. These
initial findings shifted focus towards annual mean traffic count for
each state to provide a nationwide analysis of traffic impact on
national parks, rather than in attempts to encompass every level of
information.</p>
<p>With the nuances of each state and traffic count data, we decided
that rather than to create iterative analyses into each state and their
national parks, we went down the path of curating and data wrangling to
contribute towards the wider knowledge community through our shiny
app.</p>
<p>However, traffic counts may not be the best estimator for the impact
of automobiles on human-wildlife interactions in national parks. This is
because traffic count data does not specify the type of traffic it
includes. It could be national park maintenance vehicles, visitors, or
cars merely passing through without interacting with the park. To more
directly quantify the impact of automobiles on national parks, examining
parking lot usage may be more insightful. Parking lots are clearly
man-made and reflect the park’s demand for car access, indicating
efforts to accommodate visitors. By connecting traffic flow data with
parking lot usage, we can better understand the needs of national parks
and potentially improve traffic management and parking facilities.
Plotly allows overlaying of two information datasets for a comprehensive
view without cluttering the visual.</p>

<h2>Shiny App</h2>
<p><a
href="https://fp2513.shinyapps.io/fp2513_shiny_dashboard/">This</a>
Shiny app enables the selection of two different states: one for Chart 1
and another for Chart 2. This allows users to compare traffic counts
side-by-side across years, with data further broken down by month.</p>
<p>The app addresses previous limitations where we had to generalize
data in our plots. By leveraging the app, users can gain a more detailed
and interactive view of the traffic count dataset, enhancing the
visualization experience and understanding of national park traffic
counts.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>A key limitation of this analysis is that it represents only an
initial step in the comprehensive study of traffic patterns and their
implications in national parks. The current analysis, while insightful,
provides a broad overview and suggests several avenues for further, more
detailed research. Future studies should aim to delve deeper into
specific aspects of human-wildlife interactions and environmental
impacts.</p>
<p>For instance, one critical area for further investigation is the
quantification of pollution levels within national parks over the years.
This could include analyzing the types and sources of pollutants, their
temporal trends, and their effects on local ecosystems and wildlife.</p>
<p>Additionally, understanding visitor experience and satisfaction
through systematic surveys can offer valuable insights into the adequacy
of current infrastructure. Surveys could assess the effectiveness of
parking facilities, the sufficiency of amenities, and overall visitor
satisfaction. This data would be instrumental in guiding resource
allocation and infrastructure development to better meet visitor needs
and protect park environments. This could involve spatial analysis to
identify underserved areas and model the potential impact of proposed
infrastructure improvements.</p>
