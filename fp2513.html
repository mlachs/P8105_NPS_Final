<h1>Nature vs Machines</h1>
<p>In this page we will explore historical data to inform us on how the
exponential development and accessibility of automobiles to the general
public impacts our interaction with national parks.</p>
<div id="deciding-on-the-topic" class="section level2">
<h2>Deciding on the topic</h2>
<p>To examine how our interactions with national parks have evolved over
time, there are numerous aspects to consider. Instead of selecting a
topic at random, we wondered if news articles about parks could provide
insight into major areas of focus.</p>
<p>For instance, if certain topics repeatedly appear in the news, it
could indicate ongoing changes or developments in those aspects of
national parks, making them worthy of further investigation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tm)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

text_data = data %&gt;% 
  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% 
  select(data) %&gt;% 
  unnest(data) %&gt;% 
  select(title, abstract, relatedParks, releaseDate)

clean_text = function(text) {
  text &lt;- tolower(text)
  text &lt;- removePunctuation(text)
  text &lt;- removeNumbers(text)
  text &lt;- stripWhitespace(text)
  text &lt;- removeWords(text, stopwords(&quot;en&quot;))
  return(text)

<pre class="r"><code>library(wordcloud)

word_count = tidy_titles %&gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

wordcloud(words = word_count$word, freq = word_count$n, min.freq = 20)</code></pre>
<p><img src="fp2513_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Consequently, there was no consistently reported topic across the
years.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we determined that the most relevant development in
recent history is the introduction of automobiles to the public. This is
highly relevant for examining how our exponential relationship with
automobiles and other forms of transport has changed our interaction
with national parks, particularly in terms of human-wildlife
interactions as traffic to these parks has increased.</p>
<p>Many national parks emphasize preservation, but with increasing human
contact, management needs to be flexible. To quantify how human-wildlife
interactions have changed over the years, we can look at visitation
pressure. High traffic volumes indicate heavy visitor use, leading to
environmental degradation, pollution, and wildlife disturbance.
Understanding traffic patterns helps inform management measures to
protect sensitive ecosystems and manage human-wildlife interactions
effectively. This can help prioritize areas for resource investment or
upgrades, such as waste management, road improvements, and parking
facilities. Tracking changes in traffic over the years can also indicate
broader trends related to climate change, demographic shifts, and
changing recreational preferences.</p>
<p>A limitation of this approach is that a more thorough qualitative
analysis could have been conducted if more time were available to do a
better search of major topics of focus, rather than relying on an R
function to count the features of terms in the articles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="initial-data-exploration-and-recognition-of-limitations"
class="section level1">
<h1>Initial Data Exploration and Recognition of Limitations</h1>
<p>Analyzing traffic flow can provide insights into whether current
infrastructure meets visitor needs. High traffic flow and potential
congestion can lead to increased fuel consumption, decreased
productivity, negative impacts on local businesses, and higher pollution
levels. Optimizing traffic flow is essential.</p>
<p>To achieve more granularity, I decided to separate the analysis by
state. Different states have different types of national parks, each
requiring varying levels of traffic flow (some parks may be more
accessible by car than others).</p>
<p>A key limitation is the dataset’s high level of granularity, which
required prioritizing specific aspects for this analysis. For example,
traffic counts at different entrances or roads within a single park can
vary significantly.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>his_traffic_df = read_csv(file = &quot;data/(east) Query Builder for Traffic Counts (1985 - Last Calendar Year).csv&quot;, 
                           na = c(&quot;NA&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% 
  filter(park_name %in% c(&quot;Fire Island NS&quot;, &quot;Gateway NRA&quot;, &quot;Saratoga NHP&quot;))

ggplot(his_traffic_df, aes(x = year, y = traffic_count_total, color = traffic_counter)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = &quot;Traffic Count Totals by Year for Selected Parks in New York&quot;,
       x = &quot;Year&quot;,
       y = &quot;Total Traffic Count&quot;,
       color = &quot;Traffic Counter&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) +
  facet_wrap(~ park_name, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="fp2513_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Additionally, each state has a mix of park types, leading to
disparities in traffic counts across different national parks. Analyzing
every national park in every state would be overwhelming. Therefore, we
decided to use the annual mean traffic count for each state to provide a
nationwide analysis of traffic impact on national parks.</p>
</div>
<div id="mean-annual-traffic-count-by-state" class="section level1">
<h1>Mean Annual Traffic Count by State</h1>
<p>The mean annual traffic counts for each state across the years are
presented below. It would be interesting to investigate whether obvious
increases or decreases in traffic counts are due to changing interest in
national parks or the introduction of popular parks incentivizing
visits.</p>
<p>(find all the plots for the seperate states and position them
here)</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-app" class="section level1">
<h1>Shiny App</h1>
<p>To contribute our data analysis of comparing traffic counts and
national parking lot data to the wider knowledge community, to whoever
may need this information we have created a shiny app. This shiny app
allows selection of two different states to compare the traffic count
across the years and also seperated by the months.</p>
<p>This is also in attempts to address parts of our limitations where we
have comprimised the information provided in the dataset. In the shiny
app, each state’s plot not only shows how their traffic count has
developed across the years but this development is also seperated by the
months. This provides insight into potential monthly trends, where more
traffic may occur through the year. Or even unexpected consistently in
traffic count through the year.</p>
</div>
<div id="pairing-traffic-count-with-parking-lot-data"
class="section level1">
<h1>Pairing Traffic Count with Parking Lot Data</h1>
<p>The mean annual traffic counts for each state across the years reveal
trends that can be used to investigate whether fluctuations are due to a
decreased interest in national parks or the introduction of popular
parks incentivizing more visits.</p>
<p>However, traffic counts may not be the best estimator for the impact
of automobiles on human-wildlife interactions in national parks. This is
because traffic count data does not specify the type of traffic it
includes. It could be national park maintenance vehicles, visitors, or
cars merely passing through without interacting with the park.</p>
<p>To more directly quantify the impact of automobiles on national
parks, examining parking lot usage may be more insightful. Parking lots
are clearly man-made and reflect the park’s demand for car access,
indicating efforts to accommodate visitors. By connecting traffic flow
data with parking lot usage, we can better understand the needs of
national parks and potentially improve traffic management and parking
facilities.</p>
<p>We could expect that high traffic counts in a state’s national parks
might incentivize a higher ratio of parking lots to parks in that state.
States that do not follow this trend may need updates to their parking
infrastructure. Even if not, this analysis would encourage a closer look
at the types of parks that, despite high traffic flow, do not require
additional parking lots. We focused on the ratio rather than the
absolute number of parking lots because states with more national parks
would naturally need more parking. This approach avoids disproportionate
representation and ensures a fair comparison.</p>
<p>We created an interactive US Plotly map where each state’s color is
based on the ratio of national park parking lots to the number of parks.
Hovering over a state reveals the state name, ratio, and additional
traffic count data, including minimum and maximum counts and their
respective years. This visualization combines infrastructure and visitor
trends, providing detailed insights without cluttering the visual.
Plotly allows overlaying of the two information datasets (traffic counts
and parking lots) for a comprehensive view.</p>
<p>(put plotly here)</p>
</div>
<div id="concluding-remarks" class="section level1">
<h1>Concluding Remarks</h1>
<p>A key limitation of this analysis is that it represents only an
initial step in the comprehensive study of traffic patterns and their
implications in national parks. The current analysis, while insightful,
provides a broad overview and suggests several avenues for further, more
detailed research.</p>
<p>Future studies should aim to delve deeper into specific aspects of
human-wildlife interactions and environmental impacts. For instance, one
critical area for further investigation is the quantification of
pollution levels within national parks over the years. This could
include analyzing the types and sources of pollutants, their temporal
trends, and their effects on local ecosystems and wildlife.</p>
<p>Additionally, understanding visitor experience and satisfaction
through systematic surveys can offer valuable insights into the adequacy
of current infrastructure. Surveys could assess the effectiveness of
parking facilities, the sufficiency of amenities, and overall visitor
satisfaction. This data would be instrumental in guiding resource
allocation and infrastructure development to better meet visitor needs
and protect park environments.</p>
<p>Moreover, examining the distribution of resources, such as parking
lots and other facilities, in relation to traffic patterns can highlight
areas where investments are needed. This could involve spatial analysis
to identify under-served areas and model the potential impact of
proposed infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>In summary, while this initial analysis provides a foundational
understanding, it underscores the need for more targeted research to
address specific questions related to environmental impacts, visitor
experiences, and infrastructure adequacy in national parks. These
efforts will contribute to a more nuanced and actionable understanding
of how to balance conservation efforts with visitor needs in these
treasured natural spaces.</p>
